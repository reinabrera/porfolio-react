                Formerly a Junior WordPress Developer where I honed my skills in
                building and maintaining numerous WordPress websites. My journey
                in web development has led me to specialize in creating dynamic
                and interactive websites using PHP, CSS/SASS, JS, and, just
                recently, diving into other framework, languages and tools such as  C#, ASP.NET, EF Core, and more to fully expand my skills and
                knowledge in web development.

                I'm on a constant journey to elevate my skills and embrace best
                practices. My ultimate goal? To deliver top-notch projects
                characterized by high-quality, efficiency, responsive and
                pixel-perfection.

                Productivity and accountability are among my greatest strengths,
                coupled with an unwavering dedication to continuous improvement.
